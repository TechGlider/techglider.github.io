&lt;p&gt;I recently graduated with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/masters/&#34;&gt;master&amp;rsquo;s degree&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.brown.edu&#34;&gt;Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brown.edu&#34;&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt;. My project report that documents the work I did over the last one year is now available on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/masters/&#34;&gt;Brown CS website&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/masters/2017/singhal.kartik.pdf&#34;&gt;https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/masters/2017/singhal.kartik.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am making a copy available here as well: &lt;a href=&#34;https://techglider.github.io/kartik-scm-report.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional storage stack necessitates a separate data format for the persistence of in-memory data structures, requires additional code for conversion to that data format and wastes a lot of CPU time. Upcoming byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies such as memristors or phase change memory offer an opportunity to rethink how code interacts with persistent data. Researchers have come up with a variety of programming models to make effective use of NVM but, unfortunately, it is considered hard to reason about the safety properties provided by these models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this report, we look at existing work in a somewhat related field of formal reasoning about the correctness of concurrent software and discuss whether those techniques can be applied to software designed for NVM or persistent memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also document our design of a concurrent graph data structure for non-volatile memory which offers crash-resilience with the help of Atlas programming model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s Time for a New Old Language</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;William (Bill) Gasarch writes on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/&#34;&gt;Computational Complexity blog&lt;/a&gt; about a recent talk that Guy Steele gave at Harvard on Harry Lewis&amp;rsquo;s 70th birthday (&lt;em&gt;some spellings corrected&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy Steele gave the most technical talk and it was, as the kids say, awesome (do adults still say &amp;lsquo;as the kids say&amp;rsquo;?) Here is a version of the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:40150:0::::P40000_PUBLICATION_ID:4986&#34;&gt;A Logical Concern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its about how papers at POPL and some other conference have been informally using a language to specify protocols and by now its all bent out of shape. There is also some nice history of math embedded in the talk of which I&amp;rsquo;ll say one thing: one way to group terms together is by placing a bar over them. The most common use of this now is the square-root sign which didn&amp;rsquo;t always have that bar over the quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy&amp;rsquo;s talk even had some slides about his notebooks from Harvard, from a course Harry taught back in 1974 (the first course Harry taught at Harvard). Part of the course was on the sequent calculus which relates to Guys work and the current paper. Guy&amp;rsquo;s notebook had both material relevant to the current paper and doodles of things like a picture of a Church next to Church&amp;rsquo;s thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper was very labor intensive since you can&amp;rsquo;t just use a search program to search for some of the notations he was talking about. For example overbar and underbar. So he had to go through ALL of the POPL proceedings (and a few others) by hand. In 2017. Will that ever be easier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also had a two quotes about proofs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to prove something. You must seduce people into believing it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One man&amp;rsquo;s truth is another man&amp;rsquo;s cold broccoli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave it to you to figure out who these quotes are credited to (different people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk video (~42 minutes) is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/lEPmW0-EWRw?t=37m46s&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. This was an adaptation of an invited keynote that Guy Steele gave at PPoPP &amp;lsquo;17 titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018773&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Time for a New Old Language&lt;/a&gt;. The video for the original talk seems unavailable. (&lt;em&gt;Aside&lt;/em&gt;: Does ACM ever publish videos of all the talks that are recorded during their conferences? If not, why not in this day and age of convenient video distribution? I cannot find the videos for POPL &amp;lsquo;16 with a quick Google search, which I had attended and seem to recall was being recorded.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45646.html&#34;&gt;Listing on Research at Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;novel-idea-main-result-s&#34;&gt;Novel Idea / Main Result(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper describes how by identifying the core parameters in congestion control &amp;ndash; propagation time of the physical medium and bottleneck bandwidth &amp;ndash; the authors were able to come up with a new congestion control mechanism (BBR) that is refreshingly simple and performs better in most cases in both bandwidths and latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact&#34;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the &lt;a href=&#34;https://techglider.github.io/review/analysis-and-simulation-of-a-fair-queueing-algorithm/&#34;&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://techglider.github.io/review/flow-rate-fairness-dismantling-a-religion/&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; papers, I was surprised how advanced math and non-intuitive solutions had taken over the world of network management at Internet scale. This paper&amp;rsquo;s attempt to go to the very bottom of the problem by relooking at Kleinrock&amp;rsquo;s formal model of congestion and utilizing modern control theory to come up with a simple state machine as a solution is both refreshing and relaxing. The experiments performed at the Google scale over a span of services and time periods validate their reasoning and ideas. I feel comfortable to say that this paper&amp;rsquo;s contributions hold huge potential for the future of Internet architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evidence&#34;&gt;Evidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have used a variety of analyses to present convincing arguments to validate their proposal &amp;ndash; simple intuitive reasoning about the problem of congestion conforming to (classical?) research in the formal theory of communications (Kleinrock); mathematical but fairly intuitive linear programming analysis; multiple comparisons with the behavior of a previous well-optimized TCP implementation (CUBIC) and finally and perhaps most importantly experiments done on both Google&amp;rsquo;s WAN and YouTube which provide real-world insights and strong evidence in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reproducibility&#34;&gt;Reproducibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! The implementation is merged in Linux kernel version 4.9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked how, once again, the difference between a spec (TCP) and its various implementations is illustrated in this paper and how end-to-end argument is still relevant even after we have seen so many violations in existing Internet infrastructure. I would like to brainstorm about where else rethinking old ideas from scratch and reducing the problems to their very core has a potential of significant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;criticism&#34;&gt;Criticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have loved to see some graphs with mix flows of some existing TCP implementation and their interaction with BBR flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideas-for-further-work&#34;&gt;Ideas for further work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how this paper reduced the problem of congestion control to its fundamental core (RTprop and BtlBw) and is designed to stabilize while keeping the queues empty, I am wondering how many complicated queue management solutions (such as the one proposed in the previous paper we read from Briscoe) may not be required anymore and perhaps should be reevaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flow Rate Fairness: Dismantling a Religion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;author-s&#34;&gt;Author(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Briscoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;date&#34;&gt;Date&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;doi-authoritative-link-to-paper&#34;&gt;DOI/Authoritative Link to Paper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1232919.1232926&#34;&gt;doi:10.1145/1232919.1232926&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;novel-idea-main-result-s&#34;&gt;Novel Idea / Main Result(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main claim of the paper is that flow rate as a metric for fairness is completely bogus and a better metric for the same should be the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact&#34;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not completely sure how fairness criterion has/has not changed in the past 10 years since this paper was published. But my takeaway from this paper is that long-established norms should not be taken for granted and there is value in evaluating the truth for each established view from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say though that I did not find any rebuttal paper in the defense of flow rate fairness as the author of this paper demands. However, RFC 5290 presents some alternate views on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evidence&#34;&gt;Evidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not find the argument very convincing given the lack of analytical or empirical analysis. The reasoning is based on arguments from philosophy, social science and &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo; for a more accurate definition of fairness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reproducibility&#34;&gt;Reproducibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the description is not sufficient to reproduce the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of thinking about the Internet as a utility (from the net neutrality debate outside of this paper) and how another utility &amp;ndash; electricity &amp;ndash; is well distributed across the grid system fairly. I wonder if there are lessons to be learned from this analogy given the complexities and non-uniform nature of the global Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;criticism&#34;&gt;Criticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main concern with this paper is that it tries to make such a big claim about the futility of a fairness metric that has been working for a couple of decades but fails to provide enough persuasive evidence to substantiate the claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideas-for-further-work&#34;&gt;Ideas for further work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the Question section above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;doi-authoritative-link-to-paper&#34;&gt;DOI/Authoritative Link to Paper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/75246.75248&#34;&gt;doi:10.1145/75246.75248&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;novel-idea-main-result-s&#34;&gt;Novel Idea / Main Result(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper presents an improved version of the fair queueing algorithm first proposed by Nagle, discusses limitations of congestion control with FCFS queuing, presents mathematical foundation behind their algorithm and finally, discusses the performance of this new algorithm in various real world scenarios with the help of simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact&#34;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first time that performance implications of a fair queuing algorithm were studied in detail and published. Network scheduling / queue management became an active area of networks research with several other algorithms proposed later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, this paper identifies flow (called conversations in this paper) as a good criterion for bandwidth &amp;amp; buffer allocations, which has become a standard concept in the Software-Defined Networking research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evidence&#34;&gt;Evidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors come up with a methodology to emulate bit-wise round robin scheduling (which is intuitive to fairness but impractical for implementation) and provide both rigorous mathematical analysis and empirical analysis (with the help of network simulation experiments in various scenario) to justify their results. The evidence is, hence, quite convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reproducibility&#34;&gt;Reproducibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the description is enough, with a lot of work and resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, I wonder, (as the authors point out in conclusion) whether technology has matured enough in past 30 years that we can have a true implementation of a fair queuing (for a reasonable definition of &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo;)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;criticism&#34;&gt;Criticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the mathematics covered in §2.3 fairly hard to follow and perhaps it could have used further explanation. This is in contrast to the scenario diagrams presented in a later section which were both self-descriptive and had major observations pointed out in prose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideas-for-further-work&#34;&gt;Ideas for further work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/tcp.pdf&#34;&gt;Revised version that I read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;novel-idea-main-result-s&#34;&gt;Novel Idea / Main Result(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper describes the congestion-related problems observed in the erstwhile TCP variant and reports on the algorithms introduced to tackle those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact&#34;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given we are still reading/talking about this paper after almost three decades, it is fair to say the paper has had a lasting impact. Recalling the congestion control and avoidance concepts studied in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1680/f16/&#34;&gt;CS168&lt;/a&gt;, I see that most of those basic ideas originated here in this paper and its references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evidence&#34;&gt;Evidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both intuitive/mathematical and empirical analysis is described. I especially like the effectiveness of the diagrams in Fig 1 and 2. The charts are all drawn from experiments done between LBL and UCB in a real setting and hence are quite convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reproducibility&#34;&gt;Reproducibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the description is enough, with a lot of work and resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors talk about possible change in some of their results when the Internet grows large (like the introduction of a third term in the Taylor series on pg. 9) at multiple points. I would like to see what all has changed and what has stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;criticism&#34;&gt;Criticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideas-for-further-work&#34;&gt;Ideas for further work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the connections to queueing theory/control theory and even the conservation principle of liquid flow as an analogy to network flow really interesting. It also reminded me of &lt;a href=&#34;https://techglider.github.io/review/time-clocks-and-ordering-of-events-in-a-distributed-system/&#34;&gt;Lamport&amp;rsquo;s time, clocks, ordering paper&lt;/a&gt; where he was able to bring in ideas from relativity into computing. These connections, in general, suggest how sometimes well-established ideas from another field can be applied to one&amp;rsquo;s field and why interdisciplinary research makes good sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am taking a graduate seminar this semester at Brown: &lt;a href=&#34;http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2950-u/s17/&#34;&gt;Special Topics on Networking and Distributed Systems&lt;/a&gt;. This and most of the following paper reviews until early-May will be my reviews submitted for this seminar with some minor editing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This review posted here on Feb 9, 2017&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time, Clocks, and Ordering of Events in a Distributed System&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;author-s&#34;&gt;Author(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leslie Lamport&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/359545.359563&#34;&gt;doi:10.1145/359545.359563&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Section about this paper at &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#time-clocks&#34;&gt;The Writings of Leslie Lamport&lt;/a&gt; has a good note about the historical context and how Lamport&amp;rsquo;s understanding of special relativity led to his insights about ordering of computing events presented in this paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;novel-idea&#34;&gt;Novel Idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing total order of events can be used to implement any distributed system in the form of a state machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-result-s&#34;&gt;Main Result(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happened before relationship within a system establishes a partial order of events in the system, but it is not sufficient to say which event among two occurred first, hence the need for a total order. Lamport presents an algorithm to extend partial ordering to an arbitrary total ordering of events while introducing the concept of logical clocks (called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps&#34;&gt;Lamport timestamps&lt;/a&gt; these days). A distributed algorithm to solve mutual exclusion is presented which demonstrates that the participating processes could just be treated as sequential state machines which can further be used to implement any arbitrary distributed system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need for synchronization of physical clocks arises to prevent possible anomalies as observed by user (or one could synchronize timestamps over all communication in the network to maintain happened-before relationship). Lamport presents a theorem for the upper bound on the amount of acceptable drift in synchronizing physical clocks (the proof is hard to read).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact&#34;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most cited papers in Computer Science and considered one of the first true distributed systems paper. Introduces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mathematical happens-before (&amp;ldquo;happened before&amp;rdquo; in the paper) relationship, which is widely used as the basis for current distributed systems research and has found further application in other systems areas (foundation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_memory_model&#34;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/memory_model&#34;&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt; memory models; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2660193.2660224&#34;&gt;Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, a persistent programming model (that I am working with this summer)).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concept of causality / causal ordering of events in distributed systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concept of logical clocks (Lamport clocks or Lamport timestamps) which further led to development of important ideas like vector clocks in later distributed systems research (while logical clocks are just software counters, I still need to learn what vector clocks are).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.podc.org/influential/2000-influential-paper/&#34;&gt;2000 PODC Influential Paper Award&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evidence&#34;&gt;Evidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is fairly mathematical in nature. Mathematical definitions for most ideas introduced are provided which are then used to logically establish further results. Includes just one theorem which provides a upper bound on drift that is allowed in synchronizing physical time clocks but the author himself admits the proof is pretty difficult and hence is included in the Appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;prior-work&#34;&gt;Prior Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are just 4 references cited in the paper, two of which are foundational for this work, both describing relativity. Concept of causal effect is inspired from special relativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;competitive-work&#34;&gt;Competitive Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reproducibility&#34;&gt;Reproducibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the concept of logical time (given it can be used to establish total ordering) always sufficient for implementing modern distributed systems or do we always need to resort to physical clocks? How are the space overheads (described in mutual exclusion example in the paper) overcome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;criticism&#34;&gt;Criticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do physical clocks as described by Lamport (with difficult to grasp mathematics and proof) play any important rule in modern design of distributed systems (apart from time sync protocols like NTP)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideas-for-further-work&#34;&gt;Ideas for further work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper clarified many concepts about time and synchronization between processes for me which should be useful in my current summer project. A good insight was how one does not need to depend on system clock for establishing order of events among processes even on a single machine.&lt;/p&gt;
